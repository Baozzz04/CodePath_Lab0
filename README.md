# Prework - CodePath Prework iOS App

Submitted by: Bao Ngoc Nguyen

CodePath Prework iOS App is an app that has 3 labels and 1 button that changes the background color everytime the user clicks.

Time spent: 1 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps

- Messenger
    + Deleting old messages
    + Organized list of people
    + User-friendly for beginners 

- Tiktok: 
    + Smooth transitions of stories
    + User-friendly experiences: double-tap for like, subscribe button near finger
    
- Instagram: 
    + Clear user interface
    + Changing messages background images/colors

2. Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

    I want to design an app that can be used to be published in my portfolio. The app will help the recruiters to know more about me. I will add buttons and transitions between texts to create user-friendly experiences. The app needs to have a technical and pleasant to-the-eye design.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I have some challenges finding the right box specified in the instructions listed on the CodePath prework website.
